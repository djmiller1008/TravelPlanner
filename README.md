# TravelPlanner

Welcome to my TravelPlanner App! This is a personal project that I've built to help me learn more about Django and to improve my skills as a software developer overall.

## Setup

To install this app on your local machine first clone the repository:

```
$git clone https://github.com/djmiller1008/TravelPlanner.git
$cd travelproject
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```
$python3 -m venv NAME
$source NAME/bin/activate
```

Then install dependencies:

```
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After pip has finished downloading the dependencies:

```
(env)$ python3 manage.py runserver
``` 

And navigate to `localhost:8000` and you should be up and running! 

## Tests

To run the tests: 
`(env)$ python3 manage.py test`
